# 7-5: Movie Tickets
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. 
# If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; 
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; 
# and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. 
# Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tel them the cost of their movie ticket.
